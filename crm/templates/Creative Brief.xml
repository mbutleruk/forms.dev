	<fieldset legend="Why do we need a creative brief?" >
		<field name="field" type="text" >The purpose of this creative brief is to give everyone involved in the project a common understanding of what you want to achieve. The creative brief aims to give direction and ultimately serve as a benchmark against which to test concepts throughout a project. This creative brief is just a starting point and a place to launch your ideas and help focus the project - it will not identify a solution but it’s a great place to kick start the creative processes.</field>
		<field name="field" type="text" >The creative brief gives you the opportunity to clarify your objectives and reasons for embarking on the project in the first place. If you really don’t like the colour orange then this is the time to make that clear and understood - No Orange!</field>
		<field name="field" type="text" >So you think its just Bamboo who needs this creative brief? Well look again because once you have completed the creative brief you can then present it to the people within your organisation who will be most affected by what is being produced and evoke valuable feedback.</field>
		<field name="field" type="text" >That said the approval of work is best left to as few people as possible, a single point of contact who has the final decisions during the design and development process of a project prevents conflicting feedback.</field>
